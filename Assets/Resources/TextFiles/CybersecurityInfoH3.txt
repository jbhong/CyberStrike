LSB steganography is used to hide the messages sent between individuals by altering the least significant bit for each colour in an images colour coding:1
Text steganography is used to hide messages sent between individuals by changing the number of tabs, white spaces, capital letters etc. in sentences:2

Three steps to a good Intrusion Detection System (IDS) are: Monitor (analyse hosts/networks), Identify (any misuse/abnormal activities) and Asses (the severity of the situation and alert administrators):4
Anomaly-based IDS monitors system behaviour and identifies any deviation from normal usage patterns:5
Misuse-based IDS is signature based which represents patterns of well-known attacks that are stored in the database (slow process) to detect suspicious activity early:6
Cross site scripting (XSS) includes malicious code in web pages. There were so many ways to attack – JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX etc.:7
